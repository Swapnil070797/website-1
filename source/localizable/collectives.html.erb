        <h2>Collectives</h2>

        <p>Security Without Borders Collectives are groups that are created to pursue the mission of Security Without Borders in particular geographical areas or across particular themes or communities. If you are interested in creating a Security Without Borders collective, <a href="mailto:info@securitywithoutborders.org">get in touch</a>.</p>

        <p>Each collective is created at the initiative of one or multiple persons, who are vetted my the Core, the original members and founders of Security Without Borders. While we make sure to the best of our abilities that Collectives do not infringe of the core values and the Code of Conduct of the whole project, we know that with decentralzation issues might arise. If you experienced any form of misconduct or abuse, please <a href="mailto:info@securitywithoutborders.org">get in contact</a> with Security Without Borders Core so that we we can investigate and eventually take action against the responsible individual or group.</p>
