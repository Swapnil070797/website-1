      </div>
      <p>Collin Anderson is a Washington D.C.-based researcher focused on
        measurement and control on the Internet, including network ownership and
        access restrictions, with an emphasis on countries that restrict the
        free flow of information. These efforts have focused on monitoring the
        international sale of censorship equipment, identifying harm in disputes
        between network operators, exploring alternative means of communications
        that bypass normal channels of control, and applying open data to shed
        new light on increasingly sophisticated restrictions by repressive
        governments.
