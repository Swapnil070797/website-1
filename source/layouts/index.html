					<h1>
						Are you an activist, journalist, or human rights defender?
					</h1>
					<p>
						Security Without Borders is here to help. We can assist with web security assessments, conduct breach investigations and analysis, and generally act as an advisor in questions pertaining to cyber security. As security services are often expensive to come by, SWB offers these services free to organizations and people fighting against human rights abuse, racism, and other injustices.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please get in touch with us by clicking the Request Assistance button above, and filling out the subsequent form. We will try to get back to you as promptly as possibly. However, please notice that we are a volunteer network, and resources and available people might at times be scarce.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are committed to assisting everyone, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion or any other personal characteristic or identity.
