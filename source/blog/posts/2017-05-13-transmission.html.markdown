Transmissions from Security Without Borders are status updates intended for our supporters, members and partners.

Welcome to our second Transmission.

A lot has been happening. Numerous people joined our public mailing list and our [public chat](https://chat.securitywithoutborders.org/). We have already started rolling
out [some tools](https://github.com/securitywithoutborders/hardentools) and [services](https://twitter.com/swborders/status/834490202693500941), and we’ll be launching more soon. We have sent out two issues of our [newsletter](https://newsletter.securitywithoutborders.org/subscription/S19JGWrvg), which now accounts
almost 250 subscribers! In terms of assistance, we have already undertaken and completed a number of security assessments for 
NGOs, journalists and human rights projects.

In addition, thanks to the outstanding work of [Veronica](https://twitter.com/verovaleros) and all the contributors on 
[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/security-without-borders/), our current webpage is now available in more than 10 languages!

However, we have undoubtedly been struggling with structuring Security Without Borders. It’s been taking longer than we anticipated.
We are still working on setting up necessary infrastructure and we are looking into improving our website which is still lacking
some necessary content and clarifications.

Our Central Committee — that is, the fancy name for our selected trust group — is slowly growing and now counting about 40 members. 
A lot of the work we perform and the ability to work with partner organizations require trust, which complicates the process of 
involving more and more people in the Central Committee.

That said, we do need more help. We need more penetration testers, web security experts and developers that can volunteer. 
We have created a simple form for registering potential volunteers as we’ve learned that keeping up with emails just won’t 
work (in fact, apologies to all those we have not managed to reply to). [If you are interested in helping out, please check out this page.](https://securitywithoutborders.org/volunteer.html)

Spontaneous local groups and meet-ups are already happening in several parts of the world. Check out our [Wiki](https://wiki.securitywithoutborders.org) 
to learn more about them.

We are also looking to formalize relationships with existing no-profit organizations, particularly those who are already providing
emergency response and security training, in order to offer our specialized expertise to existing support networks and reduce the
need for us to directly receive assistance requests. If you’re seeking to partner with us, please [get in contact](mailto:info@securitywithoutborders.org).
