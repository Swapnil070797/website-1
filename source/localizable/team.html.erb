        </div>
        <p>Collin Anderson is a Washington D.C.-based researcher focused on
          measurement and control on the Internet, including network ownership and
          access restrictions, with an emphasis on countries that restrict the
          free flow of information. These efforts have focused on monitoring the
          international sale of censorship equipment, identifying harm in disputes
          between network operators, exploring alternative means of communications
          that bypass normal channels of control, and applying open data to shed
          new light on increasingly sophisticated restrictions by repressive
          governments.
